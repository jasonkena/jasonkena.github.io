bio: |
  I am an incoming PhD student at MIT CSAIL.

  I completed my B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics at Boston College, where I worked on [connectomics](https://connectomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) research under [Prof. Donglai Wei](https://donglaiw.github.io/). During an internship at [EPFL's CVLab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/), I also had the privilege of being mentored by [Dr. Jiancheng Yang](https://jiancheng-yang.com/) and [Prof. Pascal Fua](https://people.epfl.ch/pascal.fua/bio).

#Additionally, I interned at [Emmerich Research Center](https://www.research.emmerich.co.id/) under [Dr. Eden Steven](https://www.research.emmerich.co.id/eden-steven).
# I lead the BC Machine Intelligence Group ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@migofbc), [Discord](https://discord.gg/JDEjsEZhNr)), am a member of the [BC Experimental Math and Machine Learning Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/bcexpmmll/home), and compete as part of the BC Competitive Programming Team.
# My research interests lie in 3D instance segmentation, biomedical image analysis, and unsupervised learning.
